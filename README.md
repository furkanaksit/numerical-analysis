1st Grade vs 4th Grade Implementations of Numerical Analysis Methods
--- 

Numerical Analysis is a 1st Grade Bachelor Degree course that has the most important numerical methods for a Computer Engineer might use.
In my first year of bachelors degree, i wrote C programs for the most important methods of the course. In order the compare my programming skills, i will re-write them in Python and possible C.

The reason for me to choose Python is to be able to plot the problems and the solutions. 

List of possible methods.

 * Solutions of Nonlinear Equations
    * Graphical (?) Method
    * Bisection Method
    * Regula Falsi Method
    * Newton-Raphson Method
    * Secant Method
    * ------- Jacobi Iteration Method ------- Couldn't do it
 * Solutions of Linear Systems
    * Cramer's Method
    * Gaussian Elimination
    * Iterative Solutions
      * Jacobi Iteration
      * Gauss-Seidel Iteration
 * Interpolation
 * Numerical Derivation
   * Forward Differences
   * Backward Differences
   * Central Differences
   * Taylor's Method (Higher Degree Derivatives)
 * Numerical Integral
   * Trapezoid
   * Simpson

Matrix Class 
* Inverse of a Matrix - Gauss-Jordan Method
* Determinant of a Matrix
* Adjacent Matrix
* Cofactor Matrix
* Transpose of a Matrix

 Update: Project is missing interpolation, regression, taylor series to calculate higher degree derivatives and parser to parse from function form to matrix form for solving linear equations
 
 Update2: func method to calculate the value of a function has some problems with parser. it needs further developement, better regex pattern and a simple UI
