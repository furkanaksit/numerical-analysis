1st Grade vs 4th Grade Implementations of Numerical Analysis Methods
--- 

Numerical Analysis is a 1st Grade Bachelor Degree course that has the most important numerical methods for a Computer Engineer might use.
In my first year of bachelors degree, i wrote C programs for the most important methods of the course. In order the compare my programming skills, i will re-write them in Python and possible C.

The reason for me to choose Python is to be able to plot the problems and the solutions.
