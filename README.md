1st Grade vs 4th Grade Implementations of Numerical Analysis Methods
--- 

Numerical Analysis is a 1st Grade Bachelor Degree course that has the most important numerical methods for a Computer Engineer might use.
In my first year of bachelors degree, i wrote C programs for the most important methods of the course. In order the compare my programming skills, i will re-write them in Python and possible C.

The reason for me to choose Python is to be able to plot the problems and the solutions. 

List of possible methods.

 * Solutions of Nonlinear Equations
    * Graphical (?) Method
    * Bisection Method
    * Regula Falsi Method
    * Newton-Raphson Method
    * Secant Method
    * ------- Jacobi Iteration Method ------- Couldn't do it
 * Solutions of Linear Systems
    * Cramer's Method
    * Gaussian Elimination
    * LU Factorizations - Cholesky Method
    * Iterative Solutions
      * Richardson Iteration
      * Jacobi Iteration
      * Gauss-Seidel Iteration
 * Interpolation
 * Numerical Derivation
   * Forward Differences
   * Backward Differences
   * Central Differences
   * Taylor's Method (Higher Degree Derivatives)
 * Numerical Integral
   * Trapezoid
   * Simpson

* Inverse of a Matrix - Gauss-Jordan Method
* Determinant of a Matrix
* Adjacent Matrix
* Cofactor Matrix
